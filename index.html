			<h1>Interview</h1>
			<p>To start off, how would you say your sound has evolved from the beginning of your musical journey to your latest album To Let A Good Thing Die? How would you like for it to evolve going forward?
			With the first album, I had no budget, I made in it in the kitchen with one microphone; people would ask how I achieved the lo-fi sound, well that’s because I didn’t have any money and made it with one cheap microphone. On this album, at least I could do it in a recording studio, so it sounds a bit more grown-up. I’m also older, assured, and more confident in myself and that reflects in the music.

			Where do you draw your lyrical inspiration from? And what sort of message do you try to convey with your music?
			I draw inspiration from everything around me. It could be a book I’m reading, a film I’m watching or something someone tells me on the tube or a conversation I overhear. The message I always hope to get across is honest, reflects who I am. It’s not trying to be anything that it isn’t it’s not trying to be cool. It’s just a personal catharsis.

			Can you recall the strangest thing you’ve ever been inspired by?
			While writing this album, I once watched the 101 Dalmatians. In the intro, Pongo is looking out the window trying to find a girlfriend for his owner Roger, who is playing a beautiful piece of music on the piano. I found the song, and wrote some lyrics for it; making up an alternative ending for the story where Roger ends up getting dumped and having his heartbroken. That was quite an unusual thing to be inspired by.
